ALWAYS REMEMBER

1. If you're creating and describing for someone else, try that the other person doesn't have to bother much to reach out for every petty thing. Put it out there as good as possible.
2. Even if you're writing it for yourself, someone might have to carry on the same work for various reasons.
3. Keep trying to write succinct and polite text bodies. This will really be a good habit for a lifetime.

Misc:

-   Try to add resources it is going to be assigned to someone other than yourself
-   Always add a `on it` status if working on the feature/bug | Assigning works too while creating the issue but commenting `on it` is a must
